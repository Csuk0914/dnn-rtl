This folder contains codes and IPs needed for simulating DDR and DNN working together.

Part of training input (16383 * 128 bits) is written into DDR consecutively first, and then DNN reads from DDR these data and runs.

After downloading to local, remember to change the path in board_top.v to correctly locate train_input.dat.

If MIG IP ddr.xci cannot work, you can try re-customize this IP and follow preset configurations (by clicking NEXT and NEXT and NEXT) and regenerate it.
The .ucf file needed for this is included in the folder.

This folder is used for Glorot Normal initialization.
Each file inside contains 2000 2's complement numbers following mean-zero gaussian distribution.
The file name represents the parameter of the random number:
  s136: fi+fo=136, sigma = sqrt[2/(fi+fo)]
  frc21: the fixed point fraction part is 21 bit.
  int10: the fixed point integer part is 10 bit.
